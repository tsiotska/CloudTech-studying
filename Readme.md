### Redirecting the Output

---

We use the > symbol to redirect the output of a command. For example, to create a file called list1 containing a list of
fruit, type

```$ cat > list1```

Then type in the names of some fruit. Press [Return] after each one.

```> orange banana apple ^D (Control D to stop)```

What happens is the cat command reads the standard input (the keyboard) and the > redirects the output, which normally
goes to the screen, into a file called list1 To read the contents of the file, type

```$ cat list1```

---

### Redirecting the Output 

---

Use the < symbol to redirect the input of a command. 
The command ```sort``` alphabetically or numerically sorts a list. 
Type

```$ sort```

Then type in the names of some vegetables. Press [Return] after each one.

```carrot beetroot artichoke ^D (Control D to stop)```

The output will be

```artichoke beetroot carrot```

Using < you can redirect the input to come from a file rather than the keyboard. For example, to sort the list of fruit, type

```$ sort < biglist```

and the sorted list will be output to the screen. To output the sorted list to a file, type,

```$ sort < biglist > slist```

Use cat to read the contents of the file slist
